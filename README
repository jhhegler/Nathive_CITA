Nathive README
==============

Attention
---------

This project is in beta phase, so the most core work is done but it is still
unfit for the end user.

Most of the following is not available in the stand-alone package, to get all
the development options please download the full source tarball.


Install from source requires
----------------------------

- gcc
- python-dev / python-devel
- dpkg (for DEB packaging)
- rpmbuild / rpmdevtools (for RPM packaging)


Install
-------

1) Open terminal in downloaded folder.
2) Type "make" as user to compile the low-level libraries.
3) Type "make deb" or "make rpm" as root to create a binary package.
4) Double-click on the package to install into your distro.


Other make options
------------------

Type "make install" as root to old-school install way, then the installation
will not be registered in any database and you can not uninstall automatically
or handle versions.

Type "make unpyc" as user to delete unnecesary .pyc files. don't worry about,
it's automatic when you perform an installation. (Tip: launch Python with -B
option to avoid generating .pyc files when you are hacking)

Type "make source" as user to delete unneeded files and clean code before commit
in the version control system or redistribute as source.

Type "make spaces" as user to reformat all .py files with spaced indentation.
This also perform a trailing space/line remove.

Type "make tabs" as user to reformat all .py files with tabbed indentation,
useful if you think tab is explicit and space groups are implicit, and you like
Python Zen over PEP08. This also perform a trailing space/line remove.

Type "make gettext" to extract all language strings from source, generate a
Gettext template and update .po files. This option needs gettext package
installed.

Type "make docs" to regenerate project documentation mixing code docstrings and
additional info. This option needs sphinx package installed.


Command line options
--------------------

python nathive.py [options] [files]
nathive [options] [files]

For now the unique option available is '-d' or '--debug' to create a method
tracking log.
