Nathive developer reference
===========================

Welcome to the brand new Nathive documentation, this is just a reference of the
libraries organization and its functionalities, focused to help developers and
enthusiasts while are working or experimenting with this project, if you are
searching for other kind of documentation you could find it here_.

This reference is using Sphinx_ combined with an own documentation handler than
mixes docstring extracted from the project code and additional information
written manually by the developers, for now is practically a list of classes
and methods, but from now write documentation will be enjoyable, just give us a
bit of time.
